## Intro
I haven't really coded an Android app more than "Hello World" before so this is a learning experience that hopefully will end up in an app that I'll use.
I'm half way through the Google Course ["Developing Android Apps"](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud851) at Udacity and it's time to do some coding on my own.

## A shopping list app
Yet another shopping list app? Why not use "Out of Milk" and be done with it?

Most shopping list apps I've tried have to much stuff going on. Out of Milk is good but this app will be perfect for my needs.

## Feature wish list
